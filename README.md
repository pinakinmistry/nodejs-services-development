# NodeJS Services Development

## Express

```cmd
npm install -g express-generator
```

Even though the req and res objects are generated by the http module and have all of the same functionality, Express decorates the req and res objects with additional functionality. By conflating Node core APIs with Express APIs on the same objects the principles of least surprise and separation of concerns are violated, while also causing performance issues.

The express command-line executable that's installed by the express-generator module when globally installed generates a bin/www file that similarly allows the port to be specified via a PORT environment variable.

## Fastify

```cmd
npm init fastify

// --integrate flag can be executed in a directory with a package.json file to generate a project and also // update the preexisting package.json file:
npm init fastify -- --integrate
```

The npm init fastify command which generates a Fastify project uses fastify-cli to start the application, which automatically allows the PORT environment variable to specify the port.

## Serving web content

Static assets (content that does not change very often) should not be served by Node. Static content should be delivered via a CDN and/or a caching reverse proxy that specializes in static content such as NGINX or Varnish

Node.js could serve static content for applications with very small user bases that have a very low growth potential

Where Node.js shines however, is dynamic content. Using Node.js as a mediator for gathering data from multiple sources and rendering some output is perfect for such an evented language and non-blocking I/O platform

## Using templates with Fastify and HandlebarJS

Using three braces to denote an interpolation point is Handlebars syntax that instructs the template engine to conduct raw interpolation.

In other words, if the body template local contains HTML syntax the content will not be escaped whereas using two braces would cause HTML syntax to be escaped (for instance < would be escaped to &â€Œlt;). This should never be used when interpolating (uncleaned) user input into templates but when building a layout we need to inject raw HTML.

The body local is created automatically by point-of-view when rendering a view because we specified the layout option.

The point-of-view plugin that we registered in app.js decorated the reply instance with a view method. When we registered point-of-view, we set the root option to the views folder. Therefore, when we pass 'index.hbs' to reply.view it knows to look for index.hbs in the view folder. Similarly, the layout option that we set to 'layout.hbs' indicates to point-of-view that the layout template can be found in views/layout.hbs. So when we use reply.view here point-of-view first renders both the views/index.hbs file and then interpolates the rendered output into views/layout.hbs and sends the final rendered output of both files combined as the response. The return value of the reply.view method must be returned from the async function passed as the route handler so that Fastify knows when the route handler has finished processing the request.

## Serving static content and using templates with Express

The original focus of the Fastify framework was on building RESTful JSON services, whereas Express is more geared towards template rendering (and static serving static content). Therefore Express has these pieces built into its core whereas in Fastify template rendering is an add-on.

```cmd
npm install -g express-generator@4

express --hbs express-web-server

cd express-web-server
npm install

cd views
node -e "fs.openSync('hello.hbs', 'w')"
cd ..

cd routes
node -e "fs.renameSync('users.js', 'hello.js')"
cd ..

```

```js
// app.js

if (process.env.NODE_ENV !== 'production') {
  app.use(express.static(path.join(__dirname, 'public')));
}
```

express instance has a method named static which returns Express middleware that will serve requests that match up with any files in the public folder.

Now static hosting will only occur in development and production static hosting is left as a deployment infrastructure problem.

```js
// routes/index.js
var express = require('express');
var router = express.Router();

/* GET home page. */
router.get('/', function(req, res, next) {
  res.render('index');
});
module.exports = router;
```

Express has res.render built-in to its core and it works in essentially the same way as reply.render added by the point-of-view plugin when registered in a Fastify server - although at the time of writing Express v4 renders at about half the speed of Fastify's point-of-view in production.

## Streaming with Fastify

```cmd
npm install hn-latest-stream
cd routes
node -e "fs.mkdirSync('articles')"
cd articles
node -e "fs.openSync('index.js', 'w')"
cd ..
cd ..
```

```js
return hnLatestStream(amount, type)
```

Returning the stream (the result of calling hnLatestStream) from the route handler instructs Fastify to safely pipe the stream to the response. The reply.send method can also be passed a stream and Fastify behaves in the same way - by piping the stream as the HTTP response.

Due to Fastify handling the stream for us, any errors in the stream will be handled and propagated. If we disconnect from the Internet and then attempt to access results in server error

## Streaming with Express

```cmd
cd express-web-server

npm install hn-latest-stream

cd routes
node -e "fs.openSync('articles.js', 'w')"

```

```js
// app.js
var indexRouter = require('./routes/index');
var helloRouter = require('./routes/hello');
var articlesRouter = require('./routes/articles');

var indexRouter = require('./routes/index');
var helloRouter = require('./routes/hello');
var articlesRouter = require('./routes/articles');

// routes/articles.js
var express = require('express');
var router = express.Router();
var hnLatestStream = require('hn-latest-stream')
var finished = require('stream').finished

router.get('/', function(req, res, next) {
  const { amount = 10, type = 'html' } = req.query

  if (type === 'html') res.type('text/html')
  if (type === 'json') res.type('application/json')

  const stream = hnLatestStream(amount, type)

  stream.pipe(res, {end: false})

  finished(stream, (err) => {
    if (err) {
      next(err)
      return
    }
    res.end()
  })

});

module.exports = router;
```

The second parameter, an object with a property named end set to false prevents pipe from performing its default behavior of endings the destination stream (res) when the source stream (stream) has ended. This is important because without this, if there is an error in the source stream then res will be ended before our server can send an appropriate error response.

# Restful JSON services

REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer, and it's an architectural style that seeks to make the most of the features of HTTP/1.1. Data is communicated via HTTP response bodies, metadata is communicated through HTTP headers, and operation outcomes are communicated with HTTP status codes. The State Transfer part of REST is about shuffling state from clients to server-backends. A REST service should be stateless, an intermediate layer between a browser and a database and it should boil down to performing one or more CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete).

## Using Fastify

```cmd
node -e "fs.mkdirSync('my-service')"
cd my-service

npm init fastify
npm install
npm install fastify-sensible
```

```js
// model.js

'use strict'

module.exports = {
  bicycle: bicycleModel()
}

function bicycleModel () {
  const db = {
    1: { brand: 'Veloretti', color: 'green' },
    2: { brand: 'Batavus', color: 'yellow' }
  }

  return {
    read
  }

  function read (id, cb) {
    if (!(db.hasOwnProperty(id))) {
      const err = Error('not found')
      setImmediate(() => cb(err))
      return
    }
    setImmediate(() => cb(null, db[id]))
  }
}
```

Not only is the code in model.js contrived, the error handling is subpar. Ideally there would be a code property on the errors and a map of error constants to check against. However the point here is to emulate more real-world scenarios where integrating with libraries can be messy and less than ideal. Note that the read function uses setImmediate this is to simulate asynchronous operations. I/O operations should always be asynchronous when dealing with requests.

### 1. Using callback

```js
'use strict'

const { bicycle } = require('../../model')

module.exports = async (fastify, opts) => {
  fastify.get('/:id', (request, reply) => {
    const { id } = request.params
    bicycle.read(id, (err, result) => {
      if (err) {
        if (err.message === 'not found') reply.notFound()
        else reply.send(err)
      } else reply.send(result)
    })
  })
}
```

Function passed as the route handler to fastify.get is not an async function. This is because an async function would return a promise that would resolve immediately and the route would fail as it tries to process a response value of undefined. Or if we did return something from it, that would be the response and the call to reply.send would be too late and result in an error regarding writing to a response that has ended.

### 2. Using async/await

If we wanted to use a callback API inside an async route handler the following approach could instead be taken. Let's modify routes/bicycle/index.js to the following:

```js
'use strict'

const { bicycle } = require('../../model')

module.exports = async (fastify, opts) => {
  fastify.get('/:id', async (request, reply) => {
    const { id } = request.params
    bicycle.read(id, (err, result) => {
      if (err) {
        if (err.message === 'not found') reply.notFound()
        else reply.send(err)
      } else reply.send(result)
    })
    await reply
  })
}
```

This can be a useful approach when mixing callback-based API's and promise-based API's in a route handler.

### 3. Using `util.promisify()`

The other approach to using callback-based APIs in an async function is to promisify the API.

```js
'use strict'
const { promisify } = require('util')
const { bicycle } = require('../../model')
const read = promisify(bicycle.read)

module.exports = async (fastify, opts) => {
  const { notFound } = fastify.httpErrors

  fastify.get('/:id', async (request, reply) => {
    const { id } = request.params
    try {
      return await read(id)
    } catch (err) {
      if (err.message === 'not found') throw notFound()
      throw err
    }
  })
}
```

Note that to generate a 404 Not Found HTTP Status we throw fastify.httpErrors.notFound instead of using reply.notFound. We also throw the caught err instead of passing err to reply.send. This is extremely useful as any unexpected throw in an async route handler will result in 500 status.

```cmd
node -e "http.get('http://localhost:3000/bicycle/1', ({headers}) => console.log(headers))"

node -e "http.get('http://localhost:3000/bicycle/1', ({statusCode}) => \
console.log(statusCode))"

node -e "http.request('http://localhost:3000/bicycle/1', { method: 'post'}, ({statusCode}) \
=> console.log(statusCode)).end()"
```

For Fastify the default behavior in this scenario is to respond with a 404 as well, so this will output: 404. Other acceptable response status codes would be 405 Method not Allowed and 400 Bad Request. The reason that a 405 is not the default for this scenario is that a 404 gives less information than a 405, so for public facing services this is a more secure approach.

### Testing 500 error handling

Let's check whether the server responds with a 500 status code for an unknown error. We'll have to modify the models.js file for this one. Let's temporarily alter the read function in models.js to look as follows:

function read (id, cb) {
  setImmediate(() => cb(Error()))
}

To make sure this change is applied, restart the server (Ctrl+C and then npm run dev or npm start), then in another terminal run the following command:

node -e "http.get('http://localhost:3000/bicycle/1', ({statusCode}) => console.log(statusCode))"

The route now has an error that doesn't relate to an ID not existing, so the output of this command should now be: 500. In the async function route example, any error that doesn't have the message 'not found' is re-thrown inside the catch block. This propagates the error so that it's handled by Fastify, which auto-generates a 500 Server Error status code. In the callback-based examples of the route handler, any error that doesn't have the message 'not found' is passed to reply.send which recognizes that it's been passed an error object and from there generates a 500 Server Error status code.

## RESTful JSON services with Express

```cmd
express my-express-service

cd my-express-service
npm install

node -e "fs.openSync('model.js', 'w')"
cd routes
node -e "fs.openSync('bicycle.js', 'w')"
cd ..
```

```js
// model.js
'use strict'

module.exports = {
  bicycle: bicycleModel()
}

function bicycleModel () {
  const db = {
    1: { brand: 'Veloretti', color: 'green' },
    2: { brand: 'Batavus', color: 'yellow' }
  }

  return {
    read
  }

  function read (id, cb) {
    if (!(db.hasOwnProperty(id))) {
      const err = Error('not found')
      setImmediate(() => cb(err))
      return
    }
    setImmediate(() => cb(null, db[id]))
  }
}

// routes/bicycle.js

var express = require('express');
var router = express.Router();
var model = require('../model');

router.get('/:id', function(req, res, next) {
  model.bicycle.read(req.params.id, (err, result) => {
    if (err) {
      if (err.message === 'not found') next();
      else next(err);
    } else {
      res.send(result);
    }
  });

});

module.exports = router;

// app.js

var bicycleRouter = require('./routes/bicycle');
app.use('/bicycle', bicycleRouter);
```

```cmd
node -e "http.get('http://localhost:3000/bicycle/1', ({headers}) => console.log(headers))"
```

'content-type' property in the response headers is set to 'application/json; charset=utf-8' as Express framework has detected that the response is JSON because res.send was passed an object, and set the headers appropriately.
